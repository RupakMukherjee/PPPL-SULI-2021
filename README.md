## Implementing 3D feature tracking algorithm

The project will focus on implementing object tracking algorithms. Features that change their shape and size as they move in space (for example, cloud in blue sky, or plasma 'blobs' in 'edge' of fusion devices) are difficult to 'track' efficiently. In this project we will focus on developing a numerical tool for tracking any arbitrary shape-changing features/structures in 3D as they wander in sky or inside a 'Tokamak'.
